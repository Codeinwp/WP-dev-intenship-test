### Instructions:
- You will build a simple Gutenberg block that displays a selected post;
- In backend you will have a select / text input where you will introduce the id of the post that you want to display;
- On frontend, the block will show the thumbnail, the title, the post meta ( author, category, posted date ) and the excerpt of the post;
- We need to see that you know your way around CSS so just fetching the data and displaying it in frontend wouldn't be enough.
- You can write your stylesheet in either plain CSS, or SCSS - bonus points for using SCSS;
- You should make sure the style is responsive and works fine on mobile screens;
- In this repository you will find an attached image as an example of how the front-end should look like;
- You can get as creative as you want to;

---

### Submitting:
- Create your own repository and add your code there;
- This task should not take you more than 3 hours to implement;
- When you are done, send us a link to the repository where you added your solution, so we can check it out;
- If you get stuck at some point, send what you did up to that point, and we will look at it;

Good luck!
